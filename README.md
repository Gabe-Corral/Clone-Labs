<h2 align="center">Online Multiplayer UNO Game</h2>

## About

This is a multiplayer UNO game. The game was built using React, Nodejs, SocketIO, Express, and Django.

## Game Rules

You can find the rules [here](https://www.unorules.com/).

## Gameplay

Once logged in you will be able to create a room or join a room. This design was inspired by Jackbox and Kahoot. As of right now, the game ends when one player wins, but I will change this in the near future.

## Plans For the Project

As of right now, this is purely an UNO game, but I plan on adding more Kahoot/Jackbox styled games to this project.

## Things To Do

- Bug fixes/improve code quality
- Add a profile page
- Clean up/improve the UI
